# To run the app, use: npx next dev -p 5000 --hostname 0.0.0.0

# Original Streamlit imports:

# import numpy as np
# import sympy as sp
# import pandas as pd
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# from streamlit_drawable_canvas import st_canvas
# from utils import evaluate_function, calculate_mse, sample_points

# This is the original Streamlit implementation.
# All of this code has been migrated to Next.js with React components.
